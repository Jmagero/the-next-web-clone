# The Next Web: Responsive design

> In this project we worked on making a whole website respoonsive. We worked on the responsive elements we had seen previously such as Grid and Flexbox and we included Media Queries to be able to make the website look exactly as we wanted for different screen sizes. We als worked with background images and gradients to a very complete project that includes all the knowledge previously acquired.
